## About Me

I am a System Engineer at TCS, currently pursuing a career in Data Engineering. My goal is to build end-to-end data pipelines, automate ETL processes, and leverage modern data platforms like AWS, Snowflake, and Power BI. I am focused on mastering AWS, SQL, Python, and other tools in the data engineering ecosystem.

## Technologies Used

Here are the key technologies I work with:

- **AWS** (S3, Lambda, Glue, Redshift, Athena)
- **SQL** (MySQL, PostgreSQL, AWS Redshift)
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, PySpark)
- **ETL** Tools (Apache Airflow, AWS Glue)
- **Business Intelligence** (Power BI)
- **Data Warehousing** (Snowflake)
- **Version Control** (Git, GitHub)

## Projects

1. **Mini Project 1 - AWS Sales Dashboard**
   - Description: Created a Power BI dashboard with data flowing through S3, Lambda, and Athena queries.
   - Technologies: AWS S3, Lambda, Athena, Power BI

2. **Mini Project 2 - Real-time Streaming**
   - Description: Simulated real-time data ingestion into AWS Glue, with Redshift for querying insights.
   - Technologies: AWS Glue, Redshift, Python

3. **Major Project - End-to-End Data Pipeline with BI**
   - Description: Designed a complete data pipeline from raw ingestion to transformed data, integrated with Power BI for real-time analytics.
   - Technologies: AWS Glue, Snowflake, Apache Airflow, Power BI
